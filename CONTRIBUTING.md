# Contributing to mcp-thailaw

We welcome contributions! Follow these guidelines to get started.

Please read and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when participating in this project.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-thailaw.git
cd mcp-thailaw
git remote add upstream https://github.com/phattja/mcp-thailaw.git
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

```bash
npm run watch   # Watch mode — rebuilds on file changes
npm run build   # One-off build
```

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript with strict type safety
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Write concise, informative error messages
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Keep coverage above the enforced gate — **90% lines, 85% branches** (CI runs `npm run test:coverage` and fails below it)
- Run `npm run lint` (or `npm run security` for lint + dependency audit) before submitting
- Test with the MCP inspector (`npm run inspector`) before submitting

## Testing

```bash
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

## Submitting a PR

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Make changes in src/
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run inspector
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Open a PR on GitHub
```
